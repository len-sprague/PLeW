# PLeW documentation

First-draft documents produced from a full read of the visualizer (`layouts/index.html` and `layouts/_default/example-viz.html`). No tool code was changed in producing them.

| Document | For | What it answers |
|---|---|---|
| [01 — Code map](01-code-map.md) | Anyone reading or changing the code | What every part is, what state it touches, and how the parts depend on each other |
| [02 — Streamlining report](02-streamlining-report.md) | Maintainers | Where the tool repeats itself or works against its own goals; suggested fixes, risks and an order to do them in |
| [03 — Design guide](03-design-guide.md) | Contributors, and anyone building in the same spirit | The manifesto, the rules that follow from it, and a checklist for changes |
| [04 — User guide](04-user-guide.md) | Users, data preparers, new contributors | How to use PLeW, prepare and share data, and work on the tool |
| [05 — Test files for findings A1–A9](05-finding-test-files.md) | Anyone checking a finding or a fix | One small CSV per group-A finding (`A1-….csv` to `A9-….csv` in this folder), with steps, the expected result and what actually happens |

**Suggested reading order:** the manifesto (Part 1 of the design guide) for the *why*; the user guide for the *what*; the code map for the *how*; the report for *what next*.

**Planned next:** turn the user guide and the design guide into pages that load alongside the tool, once the wording is settled against the writing style guide.
